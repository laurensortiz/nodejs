For white people the shades are depending on two sorts of pigment, the so-called eumaline (black pigment) and pheomelanine(red pigment). The hair cells of dark haired people only contain eumelanie. Blondes have less eumaline and redheads’ hair contains mostly pheomelanine.

So what is causing the red beards? Well, more than a decade ago, researchers discovered that one gene(MC1R) on chromosome 16 plays an important role in giving people red hair. MC1R task is to make the protein melanocortin 1. This protein plays an important role in converting red pigment into black pigment.

If you end up with only one mutated MC1R gene, red hair can appear in unwanted places

When someone inherits two mutated versions of the MC1R-gene (one from each parent, Duh), less red pigment is converted into black pigment. And when you unexpectedly end up with o

Quite amazing how such a small thing can have huge consequences. But for all those who suffer from this non-rare, non-life threatening condition: you can’t change your genes. So there’s only one option for all you half-breeds: wear your ginger beard with pride!

So there’s only one option for all you half-breeds: wear your ginger beard with pride!For white people the shades are depending on two sorts of pigment, the so-called eumaline (black pigment) and pheomelanine(red pigment). The hair cells of dark haired people only contain eumelanie. Blondes have less eumaline and redheads’ hair contains mostly pheomelanine.

Well, more than a decade ago, researchers discovered that one gene(MC1R) on chromosome 16 plays an important role in giving people red hair. MC1R task is to make the protein melanocortin 1. This protein plays an important role in converting red pigment into black pigment.
